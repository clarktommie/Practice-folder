1,"The staff Alexa was very kind and helpful. I had donated 20 pizzas to my children's graduation party/dance. I went in person to make sure I placed such a large order correctly and was going to be delivered to the correct place at the proper time. I asked about getting my reward points for this extremely large order. The staff said “I’m sorry I can’t get a receipt right now”. However, I went back in a few days later she was able to print a receipt out for me and gave me a phone number to call customer service to ask that the points to be added. Customer service said the points weren’t added because they didn’t have my phone number or my name. I sent a copy of the receipt circle the top in red that has my name in phone number on it. That is how I place the order in the first place. ","May 28, 2022",1,0
2,"I ordered 4 pizzas One veggie lover, one cheese lover and two Great Beyond pizzas. When checked the toppings of the great beyond, all we got were the Soya chunks where it should be Beyond meat Italian sausage crumbles. Either the recipe is wrong or the local store is cutting corners. When called later to report this, no credit or anything just ""should've called the same day and this is only customer service you can get"". What a ""GREAT scam"" in the name of the ""Great beyond"".","May 18, 2022",1,0
3,"My experience was bad. Had a long day, want to grab a quick pizza on way home, did not want to be on internet and driving so I just stop, walked in, order. Got the large 3 topping pizza. When I saw she charged me 18.50 instead of 10 dollars they are advertising, she tells me I have to order online to get it 10 dollars. Why, it's still the same pizza. Also ran into a litter bird that work at 6625 Dixie highway Miami fl 33143. Told me at end of night they re-ring the orders, and pocket the extra for the people they overcharged on the deal pizzas.??? FYI mostly managers but split with some people that want talk.

5,Pizza Hut is a scam! I never got my pizza delivered to my house! This is terrible service. Don't order from Pizza Hut! They wouldn't let me add ingredients. I found spit in my pizza and nails in the cheese.,"May 12, 2022",1,0
6,"We keep giving Pizza Hut a chance, but no longer. From the time we order to the time we receive our food by delivery, it has taken consistently 2 1/2 hours to 3 hours. This is after the order taker claims 30 to 40 minutes. Last night, 5/2/2022, we ordered a pie approx 6:15. Was told expect deliver within 45 minutes. At 7:30, called store and they claim waiting for Door Dash to pick it up. The store is approx 5 minutes from the house. So at this point, the pie has been ready sitting under a heat lamp since approx 6:45. (Was told about 20 -25 minutes to be prepared and ready). At 8:30 pm, called again and they indicated door dash has not come to pick up the order. So why the hell do they take delivery orders if they can't get it delivered in a timely manner. Ended up cancelling order.","May 3, 2022",1,2
7,I think it's sad that the Salt and Pepper of Pizza Hut is now charged for. Grated Parmesan and Red pepper flakes should be on the table just like salt and pepper is at any other restaurant. This is absurd.. You are going to put yourselves out of business by charging for the simplest things!!! I'm surprised we didn't have to pay for a to-go box!!!!,"April 25, 2022",1,0
8,"""Dear sir, Order number Your Order No ** has been dispatched and will be delivered soon by Harman,""  This order That was fraud as in system tracking delivered 20 minutes prior the delivery boy reached. Moreover pizza was not hot and delivery boy acknowledge that backend team is forcing them to deliver in system even if physical order delivery is pending. Delivery took around 55 minutes bro deliver. Poor service by Pizza Hut. Quality degraded as compared to Domino's and La Pino pizza brands. I will not order and will escalate on social media till satisfactory action is taken from your side","April 14, 2022",1,3
9,We order to a shop close to our house. Whenever we order we get no dipping when we ask for it. The toppings are very little quantity. Example; the chicken are only like 1-2 per slice compared to other stuff.,"April 9, 2022",3,0
10,"I have called to order a pizza from Pizza Hut in Harrisonburg VA and the last 2 times and today they have hung up on me, or pretended to not hear me. Answered and said they'll call me back and hung up... no call back. It's ridiculous at this point its been several different occasions. I don't complain ever but I honestly had to say something, it's that bad and wrong. Very very disappointed I like their pizza but I'm switching to Domino's!","April 3, 2022",1,3
11,"After placing my order with what seemed like a call center out of country, I was hung up on before asking any questions. After waiting 2 HOURS I FINALLY reached an awesome person named Alan at a pizza hut near me who was able to tell me what restaurant would have my order. After calling that restaurant the girl was very short and dismissive with me. Saying ""orders are out"" and hung up. I received a soggy pizza and cold wings and I put the tip on my card so I tipped VERY WELL for horrible service and food I had to heat up after 12 hours of work! Highly disappointed!!","April 2, 2022",1,3
12,"I put an order on their website, while I was putting the order I selected my current location and the order was placed to their Noida, sector 119 outlet which is around 4km away from my delivery location. After waiting for around 40 min I got a call from them. And they were saying that my location is too far to deliver my order. When I confronted them they said to try to deliver it. But after 10-15 min they called and refused to deliver my order.","March 22, 2022",1,3
13,"I called in a order for a large 3 topping topping pizza since we had a coupon for $8.99 at the 377 Lear Rd., Avon Lake, OH 44012 Pizza Hut. I wanted only one item (black olives) on 1/2 so I thought I could get two extra items on the other 1/2. She said, ""No, the black olives counted on the whole pizza and there would be an upcharge for the other two items."" I never had this problem with an online order that I have bought so much pizza at this location. This place is not worth the trouble, not going back after this last order I placed.","March 21, 2022",1,0
14,"We called to order 10 orders of breadsticks and our boy Chris was the best man to answer. He was very respectful and thoughtful to all our confusions. Other pizza huts need guys like Chris. with love - Jacob, Chris, Jonathan","March 20, 2022",5,2

16,I walked in to an empty store front and finally someone came out to take order. He couldn’t speak English and I don’t think he understood either. A delivery guy came in and took a simple order. When I got home the order was wrong. When I called the store I was hung up on!!!,"March 16, 2022",1,0

18,"I placed an order at 2:00 pm. for a staff meeting at 6:00 pm. My order was for 7 large pizzas. My pizzas arrived at 7:00 after my meeting was over. I had nothing to feed my staff. I called the location at 62nd and Allisonville in Indianapolis IN. several times. I finally spoke to someone who told me she couldn't help me as I placed the order on line. She then transferred me to the ""hotline"" where I was hung up on three times. I have no way of getting my money refunded as I can't get through to anyone. Will never order from Pizza Hut again.","March 11, 2022",1,0
19,"2/25/22 I am terribly disappointed and after their bad behavior last night I will not be ordering from them again, ever. I ordered dinner last night for delivery. When my delivery time came and went with no food, I checked my app and it said, delivered. I called their number several times, but no one answered. After an hour of trying to reach someone, I checked Google reviews. This wasn’t the first time someone ordered, and their app said it was delivered, but hour later still no food.","March 2, 2022",1,0
20,"If you order Pizza Hut after this, you're part of the problem. So we just ordered a pizza from pizza hut. They screwed up in the bread sticks. So the guy said he was going to come back. My boyfriend call the store, got it credited so everything was all good. The guy came back anyway with bread sticks. When my guy answered the door, he told the delivery guy that he called the store and they credited him so it's all good. The delivery guy wanted us to pay him anyway. I was grabbing some cash to tip him just for coming back until he threw the bread sticks at my boyfriend and called him a ""**"". ","Feb. 28, 2022",1,0
21,"I ordered with the Stoneybrook, Louisville Ky location. I waited 1 1/2 hours for a pizza to be delivered. I live 2 miles from the store. When I called the store to check on my order they apologized for the delay and offered a credit. Of course the pizza was very cold and disappointing. I have emailed many times. Customer service agreed to the credit but I have not received it. The store manager also said I am to receive credit. They are no longer replying to my emails. This just makes a bad experience worse.","Feb. 27, 2022",1,0
22,"Not worth the price. Taste was disgusting. Very little cheese, very little meat. Crust was not cooked. Hard to chew. Crust was very thin for hand tossed and adding a dollar more for pan pizza is outrageous because there is not much of difference!!! So not worth the price! So Fed Up! Trash pizza!!","Feb. 26, 2022",1,0
23,"Order was a med Supreme. Showed up on time but it was cold, barely any toppings, more sauce than toppings. Some toppings not on. Also it tasted old as if was made before my order was placed. I will not order anything else again from 26 wasted.","Feb. 20, 2022",1,0
24,They recycle you over and over through their website. I will do everything in my power to never have Pizza Hut again. I had to enter my credit card information 10 times and redo the order over and over until they closed and now no pizza.,"Feb. 20, 2022",1,0
25,Pizza Hut has the worst chicken wings I have ever eaten.. They use the ones that you buy in grocery stores that are boxed the pre cooked kind (gross). Go order some wings from Volcano's or Rose City Pizza & compare them to Pizza Hut's wings & you will see they are rubbery just like the frozen ones from the grocery store. I will never order from here ever again. I will stick to Volcano's or Rose City because they are actual chicken wings not the frozen rubbery ones!!,"Feb. 14, 2022",1,0
26,"I can't believe Pizza Hut has removed our ability to add flavor to their tasteless, cardboard crust. Are you kidding me? You removed the parmesan crust? At least it had some flavor. Please bring back crust options or you have lost customers.","Feb. 12, 2022",1,4
27,"Pizza Hut pizza is by far my favorite pizza but the store on Vaughn Road leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered a pizza two hours before closing then five minutes before closing they called me and told me that they did not have a delivery driver and it would take 5 to 7 days to receive my money back on my card. I then called customer service to complain and to see what other options I had, And the gentleman that I spoke with after getting my information just transfer me to the store. I will never order from that store again although it’s closest to my house. I would rather not even have Pizza Hut.","Feb. 10, 2022",1,0
28,I wanted a fast dinner meal for my school age kids and ordered one pizza to be delivered. It has been over an hour and a half and we have not gotten the pizza. I have been attempting to get a human being on the phone for over forty-five minutes to no avail.

29,I ate pizza in Dubai and America. It’s awesome with cheese loaded and toppings too but here it taste like crunchy bread with not a single thread of cheese. Toppings hardly we found here in Bhubaneswar. Very poor quality.,"Jan. 26, 2022",1,3
30,Paid $30 for the dinner box. Included 2 medium pizzas. Some slices didn't have one piece of meat on them. Now for the price that was poor service. The person taking the order seemed to not know anything. Just a bad experience all together.,"Jan. 23, 2022",1,5
31,"Ordered 3 pizzas from the County Line Rd location in Fayettvile. First and last time at any Pizza Hut: it was that bad. Cheese burnt onto crust, crust hard and straight as a board, zero sauce. It was so bad that even my 8-year-old said, ""No thanks."" Nice counter experience, but when we got home we were extremely disappointed. This was further on a Wednesday night, before 6:30 PM, so not a rush time. No good reason for the awful experience.","Jan. 13, 2022",1,4
32,"I recently ordered a large pizza on Jan, 7, 2022 at the Compton Ca location. The pizza was a 3 topping pan. There was literally no sauce, barely any cheese, and very little toppings. The pizza dough was not thoroughly cooked and very little flavor. The only thing good about the pizza, it was hot, and ready when I arrived. I really wish I would of taken the pizza back. We won't be ordering Pizza Hut anymore!","Jan. 11, 2022",1,2

Really sucked.","Jan. 7, 2022",1,2
34,"Been a while since I ordered, they changed the sauce. It stinks. No flavor. You're right next to Kraft and killing their mac and cheese recipe. You need to fire your research department and your CEOs. You don't fix what's not broke, now it's broke. No reason to buy from either of you again. Good decision!","Jan. 3, 2022",1,4
35,"The Pizza Hut in Passaic, New Jersey service are horrible. My order was missing an item and another item on my order was not what I ordered. They charged 50 cent for garlic sauce and didn't put it in the bag. I placed the order on online to avoid confusion. However, reading is a problem at this place as well. Just shut down the location.","Jan. 1, 2022",1,2
36,I ordered 2 pizza and breadsticks at 5:15 pm for delivery. At 6:13 I attempted to contact the store to see where my order was. I tried 4 times to reach the store but no answer. I had my husband call and she finally answered. He asked how much longer. She said order was ready but it would be another 1.5 hours because they only had 1 driver. I instructed my husband to file complaint and ask for 50% refund since the pizza has been sitting and probably dried out. They should refund driver tip which was included in order.

37,The Pizza Hut in Columbia Heights MN is the worst pizza place that I have ever had and the people there are so rude. I ordered my pizzas and it took them a little over 2 hours just to bring it to me. I live not even 2 miles away. When I called the lady was so rude to me I have never been treated like that from a pizza place. I'm very disappointed with everything about this place.

38,"We placed an online order at 4:30pm for delivery, and we didn't get it until after 6pm. Not only was it cooled off, but it was only half our order. The delivery genius said he would let them know at the restaurant, to take it off our bill, but he didn't. I also called the store several times to follow-up, only to get the automated Pizza Hut voice-over. I wrote a complaint on the Pizza Hut website, which no one has responded (it's been more than 3 business days like they said to allow), and if you call customer service, you don't get anyone there, either. Just the same damn automated Pizza Hut voice-over that the Augusta, Maine restaurant had on repeat. It looks like this is the MO for Pizza Hut, just reading through the reviews on here from all over. I'm guessing the company is closing in 2022, because they don't seem to do anything to keep customers. They've certainly lost our business for good.","Dec. 9, 2021",1,2
39,"Placed an online ordered 6:25 p.m., was told order was received and would be ready approximately at 7:02. However that was not true! I stood and waited oh so patiently for 2 hrs! The order was still not ready for pick! The manager was very oh so rude while yelling in the store to the other associates to bring her whatever products she needed at the time! Oh and don’t let me leave out she refused to come to the front counter to speak with the customers upon our request. No one was removing the products from the oven as they came up therefore everything that was in the oven was very much so BEYOND BURNED! On top of that one of those burned products was MINE!

Suddenly she put me on hold for a year...(very long waiting) after realized, no one call or reply. I called back and put another order and asked to make sure not double order then she put me on hold for a month....(long waiting). I called back for the 3rd times, the customer service told me to forward the call to manager. I even asked, for how long the manager would pick up the call? She said soon. Unfortunately, no reply.

43,Pathetic service. Worst experience I ever had. This is the first time I had ordered from Pizza Hut. Unfortunately it has been delayed by 1hour and 50 mins. In spite of that the pizzas were horrible. Awful taste. It tasted like a raw pizza without any cheese and toppings. I had paid extra for cheese but there was no cheese neither any veggies. It was empty. I never ever expected this from pizza hut. Which is known for the best pizzas across the world. I called up customer care but there also I did not get any response. Neither they have refund my money nor they entertained it seriously. I did a big mistake ordering from here.,"Oct. 10, 2021",1,9
44,"I paid $24 for a Detroit style pizza. I was notified it was on the way (I live 15 minutes or less from the restaurant) and it took an hour to arrive. The pizza was cold, and the toppings were ridiculously sparse. I paid for pepperoni (there was none) and sausage (there were about 12 pieces) and mushroom (there were around 8 pieces). The pizza was almost bare. I tried to call the restaurant and was told I would be transferred and was on hold for over 5 minutes. I'm done. I will never order from Pizza Hut again. I can get 3 pizzas from Dominos at this price that are hot, fresh, and chock full of toppings. Pizza Hut, you can do better.","Oct. 10, 2021",1,4

I also ordered a side of bottle of pop and bread sticks. I also asked for curb side pick up so I didn’t have to get the children out of their seats to go in. Because of this I tipped 25 percent on my order. Big mistake!!! I got there. The app wasn’t working so I couldn’t check in. I tried calling but no one picked up. I kept trying to call. Eventually gave up. I got the kids all undone from their car seats. Went in. I noticed there was only one family in the lobby.

57,For the first time in several years I ordered a pizza online to pick up at Pizza Hut. I should have read these reviews first. My pizza was ready a half hour after it was supposed to be brought to my car. It was overcooked and so salty as to be inedible. So unhealthy.

How, exactly, is that going to work? Why would they just credit me my money out of the blue? Personally I think she was just trying to get rid of me. So I guess I'll just have to dispute the charge with my credit card company. We'll see what happens, but I doubt I'll ever be ordering anything from Pizza Hut again.","July 24, 2021",1,8
60,"After ordering the pizza, paying a delivery charge (which sole purpose seems to be to decrease the driver's tip while enriching the corporation), paying taxes, and tipping the driver 15% (it would have been 25% without the delivery charge) my total was about $30.00. And for $30.00 I received 4 small bottles of Diet Pepsi (real value: about $2.00) and a pizza that had a leathery, dry crust and dry vegetables (real value: about $3.00). I'm assuming the pizza was sitting under a heat lamp before delivery for a couple of hours. Doing the math, the corporation took $25.00 from me. Yum!

They are charging for stuff now that use to be standard. The crust is dry with no flavor unless you pay $2 extra for deep dish. The cheese is hard and looks synthetic unlike the white cheese that use to string from your mouth in the past. And most of all the lacking of toppings, no sauce and very stingy on the toppings. But the price is still is pretty steep unlike other pizza chains that taste just as bad. ","Sept. 15, 2020",1,2

Only a few tiny pieces of pineapple and Canadian bacon that looked like extra thin pieces of pepperoni. The border of the pizza was stuffed and good as far as the cheese was concerned, but there was hardly anything on the pizza. The crust was soft, floppy and undercooked. It was not slightly brown underneath. When you pay $40.00 for a pizza and a drink, including the tip and the delivery charge, you expect a pizza with sauce and cheese on it along with the toppings!

At first I got warnings I was putting too many toppings on, but it still allowed it and when I received my pizza it has been correct 99% of the time. On the very few occasions, something was incorrect, they were quick to replace it. While other pizza chains are advertising delivery insurance, Pizza hut has always had it. I trust them to make my pizza right and if they don't, to make it right either that same time or at a later date. They have given me a free pizza voucher for the times I did not have the time to wait for another delivery.","Dec. 29, 2019",4,10

Prices for the wings compare to other places and they are tasty. The macaroni dishes are also salty, but somehow satisfying. Temperature of foods is always good. I rarely eat at any chain restaurants due to the prefabricated, not quite real food quality.

So I called the Pizza Hut in Desert Hot Springs. They said they could not honor the online price. They said they could take the order but they added a fee to the price due to the fact they were in California. Yes they added a fee of whatever they wanted to the price advertise online.

I’m sorry, but I believe if you do it right the first time, you don’t have to have customers coming back wasting time, gas and effort for you to get it right a second time!!!! What a lousy busy practice model. I should have read the “writing on the wall” when I got there and the parking lot was empty!!!","June 17, 2019",1,2
202,The order that I placed online was wrong. I had trouble with the website in the first place. I ordered a pepperoni lovers with two other toppings and did get the pepperoni on it. It was on my order confirmation email but wasn't made right.,"June 16, 2019",1,0
203,"Without a doubt the worst pizza I ever had. The crust was the texture of a cracker and tough, I think it was left from the day before, the pepperoni and mushrooms were paper thin and I am not sure if the white stuff was cheese or not, I called and complained and was told that's how they are. That will be the last Pizza Hut pizza I ever order.","June 7, 2019",1,0
204,"At night some friends and I got hungry, so naturally, we order pizza for delivery. So, after ordering our food with a bit of trouble (there were delivery minimums that had to be met, and supposedly were in the subtotal, but it didn't account for coupons) we learn that it would take 70-80 minutes to deliver our food when it said 20-30 minutes before we had ordered. It wasn't terribly late either, only 8:30 and for a larger chain like Pizza Hut, shouldn't orders like this be fairly common? And why even bother with delivery when it would be faster for me to walk to the restaurant, wait around for 10 minutes, and walk back food in hand. So overall, a terrible experience and would recommend going elsewhere.","June 2, 2019",1,5
205,"The pizza hut in Cedar Hill has the worst customer service. Placed online order, called the store and the customer service is horrible and the manager is horrible.

When we called up there to find out what was taking so long the lady said she couldn’t do anything but call the delivery lady. Never did we hear back and it was still 10 minutes after the call that the food even showed up! On top of that the food was disgusting and not even done all the way. So all together we waited an HOUR and 10 minutes! I will never do delivery with Pizza Hut on Ruth Street in Sulphur again. Multiple times our food hasn’t been done.,"May 25, 2019",1,0

210,"Tonight, around 7 pm, I ordered pizzas for my kids. Let’s keep in mind I was spending my LAST $30 until tomorrow because spending $27 on pizza is cheaper and more efficient than going to the grocery store (5 teenage boys, pizzas for $5 and points for breadsticks for my daughter who doesn’t eat pizza). Anyhow, they decided that they don’t deliver to my area. I was cleaning up my son (he’s disabled) when I received a call from an unfamiliar area code so I didn’t answer because scammers call from this area code and it was NOT a local area code.

The P-Zone's were syrupy sweet and the marinara was even sweeter-no thanks-straight to the trash can, all of them. Tasted like someone dumped a large amount of sugar in them. The pizza had no flavor and was dry and hard/crunchy, hardly any sauce at all. What a waste of $$$. Every item was nasty to 3 different people. Says a lot.","April 25, 2019",1,3

They are soft and you can't hold them, there was a brownish yellow stuff dripping out of them so now our clothes are in the washing machine! They put the wrong dip in each box so we were eating the wrong Calzone and I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth. Two Calzones and 2 pop cost $32, so not only are we a greasy mess, it was a HUGE RIPOFF. Goodbye Pizza Hut. Stick your messy food and your high prices!","April 20, 2019",1,3

214,"I used the last of my money to get whatever I could for my kids as they begged for pizza. Found the dinner box that was a good deal and would feed them all. Turns out by the time I got it an hour later it was cold. It was hard, I couldn't take a bite hard. The breadsticks I asked for was cheesy bread, they gave me the regular sticks but was so greasy I moved the box and it was run off not to mention those being completely unedible and burnt. The cinnamon sticks they gave were hard and just grease. I could barely see or wipe off any cinnamon. With both sticks I couldn't make a finger imprint when I pushed down. It went nowhere. I am HIGHLY disappointed. Not only did I waste the only money I had but my kids couldn't eat. I am never going to Pizza Hut chain again. If this is what they serve I want nothing to do with it. I'll continue to go to Little Caesars or Domino's before I go to Pizza Hut again. I am so upset.","April 16, 2019",1,3

The location on South High never answer their phone to be able to place the order, and I have been sitting at the window for over 20 minutes, nobody has come to me or acknowledged me. This is the worst customer service and really needs to be evaluated. I am a manager and if my customer service was ever this bad someone would be dealt with or fired. Please check into both areas, this needs to be addressed as there are so many other places to eat, that this may be my last attempt with Pizza Hut.","April 11, 2019",1,0

218,"My pizza was barely warm when it arrived, and very dried out. They do not put the mushrooms under the sauce which also causes them to be dried out. The cheese is so scarce, that you can actually see right through to the dough. No pizza should look like that. My pizza also had a poke into it, as if a finger had pressed right into my pizza, right down through the sauce and dough and it was still delivered this way. Also, the delivery man put my 2 liter of pop down on the porch in front of my door instead of handing it to me. When I asked where my 2 liter was he pointed to it on the ground and said, ""It's right there"". This place needs to go out of business already and be a thing of the past.

I then sent an email to corporate and was told that I would be contacted, I never was, so I sent another email with my contact information and still was sent no follow up email nor did I receive a call.

The Classic pizza sauce does not even have the slightest taste of a tomato sauce like most pizzas have. Their pizza cheese does not taste like a good pizza cheese, mozzarella or provolone. Overall, Pizza Hut makes the worst pizza I have ever had! Anyone can Out Pizza the Hut! The only reason I gave them a one star review is because they were very prompt on delivery, I l had to throw out most of the pizza. I do not feel it was a quality pizza as they advertise!","March 10, 2019",1,3

The marinara sauce that did come with the order was cold and tasted... off. Side note: I was AGM of Romeo's Pizza, Little Caesars and a delivery driver for Minuteman Pizza.

If your manager knew this the order was placed, he should have told me and I could have ordered from another company. He did say (from the background) that he could only give me $10 off of my order.

But this last time, I was very disappointed with the quality of my large, stuffed crust, hand tossed pizza. It was not up to the quality of pizzas in the past. It almost tasted like it wasn't fresh. And the toppings were skimpy. I hope this was just an isolated occurrence.","Sept. 24, 2018",2,0

So I have to pay extra for them to make my pizza? That's ridiculous! By the time I ordered my pizza... They added tax and then the service fee the pizza cost nearly $10 more and if I wanted delivery it would have been service fee, tax, delivery charge then a tip for the delivery guy. That adds $15-$20 on to the order! I've decided to stop eating Pizza Hut altogether because there are other pizza places that don't do this... Bye Pizza Hut!!!","Sept. 18, 2018",1,5

Nothing major, however the salad bar was empty, bottom can be seen of most containers, the breadsticks had more parmesan cheese than the cheese itself, one pan pizza was supposed to be crispy however the other was.

Me being vegan I couldn't eat anything so I had to go to Mod Pizza, which we should have went to in the first place!

Then treating hourly employees so horrible they were leaving in tears because of management mistakes that they are trying to blame on employees. Horrible. They also force employees to purchase drinks while they work not providing anything to drink for free. Disturbing that the one good manager up there thought it was wrong and purchased waters for his employees out if his own pocket. Meanwhile the manager Barb eats their food in front of employees and doesn't pay. This place disturbs me!!!!,"May 4, 2018",1,16

The lady that answered stated she needed to speak to the manager, I could hear him in the background yelling and cursing about my situation. Told the lady to tell me If I wanted another pizza sent I would need to return the pizza with the hair on it, but there was no way I would take another pizza from them, I don't think anyone else would either after hearing the manager's level of professionalism, or lack thereof.","April 27, 2018",1,11

I called again and the person on the phone said I had to be put on hold because they were busy with customers, although the reason the person answered my call was to possibly take a new order. I've tried calling again and again but I can't get through. A few days ago I had a very similar situation with the same Pizza Hut. I actually had to drive to the store to get my order corrected. I am LIVID, and I won't do business with these thugs anymore. They should be ashamed of themselves for how they conduct business, but I guess it's the American way.

He might of notice that there was a charge for 4 Ranch dippings and it wasn't there for you to deliver the complete order. He just mumbled and then said ""I just grab the orders and deliver.

When I explained the difference between lasagna noodles and scroodles they said ""meaty marinara is what we call it."" That's fine and dandy.

He refused to refigure the total since the three items at 7.99 and the one that was 11.99 would still not add up to 49.20. He refused.

One other time we complained because the pizza ordered made everyone who ate pizza extremely sick with vomiting and diarrhea for days after the pizza. We wanted to alert them so no one else would get sick in case there was something contaminated there at the store. They acted like we were the ones with the problem. We didn't order from them for about 4 years and decided to give them a try again. But this latest experience is the last time we trade with Pizza Hut. We ordered pizza for our party and spent $175.00 for pizza at another store.","Aug. 6, 2017",1,6
315,"I've never had a problem with Pizza Hut until today. Let me explain to you EXACTLY what happened. I have phone recording and credit card receipt proof for anyone who questions me about it. First, I placed an order online to Pizza Hut website. (Like I always have) - They usually get it to me within 30 minutes, always great, but TODAY - Horrible. I place the order at 4:38 pm - still wasn't here at 5:25 - I called and the person who answered said it's on its way according to tracker. I said, ""It has said that for 30 minutes now and still not here. You charged my card 33.05 but my order was only 27.95."" Hung up the phone when he said maybe the driver got lost. I said, I live 1 mile away and it's been an hour.","Aug. 4, 2017",1,14

A delivery guy comes in, goes to the back and comes back to front and says, ""I GUESS she will be with you soon"" so I wait and wait and wait, thinking maybe she is in back doing paperwork or busy. NOPE, she comes thru the front door carrying a grocery bag with a 2-liter soda in it. Let's not forget there is a BIG HUGE cooler IN Pizza Hut with Pepsi products and water in it. Did she put her item down immediately and apologize to me? Again NOPE. She walks over to the delivery guy and proceeds to have a conversation, all while I am waiting and waiting. When she finally decides to do her job, she walks to register. This would be the part where an employee should say, ""I am sorry for your wait"". Did she? If you guessed NOPE, you'd be right.

317,"Decided to order Pizza Hut for my sons 12th birthday. Hadn't ordered in a while and decided it would be a nice change. The last time I ordered there, the Pizza was delicious. They must have changed the recipe to compete or be more like Little Caesar's because that's what it tastes like. Crust with cheese on it. A freaking cheese stick. At least Little Caesar's has this kind of pizza for five bucks, but Pizza Hut has the gall to charge 15.99 and upward for the same thing. You guys need to return to the recipe you had for years, because this new stuff you're selling is TRASH.","July 28, 2017",1,12

We placed an order for delivery and 45 min later the driver called and said “We don't deliver to you.” So when I called the store to ask “Why wasn't it said when I called?” The shift manager ** said “Oh well you can come pick it up. That's all I got for you.” and hangs up when I ask for the general manager info. I'm not pleased with the service at all and how rude they were to me on the phone. ** I assume is his real name hung up the phone. This is not how Pizza Hut do business and I feel very disrespected. That store number is 4935 but only assuming the information was right because I called back and it rang for like two minutes before ** answered the phone and sounded like he was reluctant to give me information.

We finally ask for our bill then was told our food was on its way. Got our bill for what we ate and drank and was finally told that our ticket had gotten misplaced.

It looked like plastic. When I raised it with the manager he tried cutting it with a knife and it didn't cut into pieces. I was discussing this with him asking him what it may be. It's disappointing.

So one night I ordered a personal pan ham and pineapple and one of their new ""Hershey S'mores Cookie"". This thing was not a cookie! It was more like a cake and super sweet. I wrote a complaint and they sent me a coupon for a free large Pizza. The next time I ordered for delivery, I ordered 2 personal pan pizzas, one pineapple and ham with Garlic Butter Blend and a BBQ Beef with Hut Favorite. Well when they arrived, they weren't hot and neither one of them had crusts on them (glad they don't charge for the flavored crusts). But the BBQ beef looked like someone had pooped on my pizza.

I wanted the pizza to go to and the money would be back on my card by the Monday 17th. Go forward to today the 18/7/16 and after ringing Pizza Hut complaint dept for the 15th time it's a free number so no cost there. I was told I would probably get my money back next Thursday 25th. Now to a big company like them 20 pounds may not be important but to a mum on a budget it means a hell of a lot but I'm so angry because there are no comebacks for these large companies who make mistakes and take forever to rectify them.

The customer service agent said she will try to have it delivered the soonest possible time. To our surprise, our order came in 30 mins. Pizza was hot and they gave us the extras we requested. We've always loved pizzas and I'm satisfied how the cs made it possible to have it delivered fast and hot.

387,"Pizza Hut gives that comfy cozy dining experience plus I love their caesar salad, their mushroom soup and their crab salad roll. Their staff are also very very warm and accommodating. However, I couldn't give their pizza the thumbs up. Over the years, the dough has become dry and oily. Their toppings dry and lacking. You will enjoy the pizza a bit if you eat it right there in the restaurant but once you eat it later, it tastes stale and plain. Their pasta also tastes uncooked and hard at times, and though I love their soup recipes, more often than not it taste burnt. They should really look into what they are doing wrong. I have loved Pizza Hut more than our local pizza place before but not anymore. I am still satisfied with them but I do not wish to be only satisfied.

Back then their pizza was actually really good, and I always looked forward to eating there during special occasions. Now they have all these affordable promos and more people are eating there, and it has led to a decrease in quality of their food. Sometimes there are barely enough toppings, sometimes even the soup isn't hot, and the servers all seem too busy to pay any attention. I miss the Pizza Hut during my childhood when eating there was always a special time. Now it just seems like any other cheap pizza joint. What a shame.

The cashier said they couldn't find the pizzas and we should wait 15 min while they remade our order. We waited 30min and asked if it was ready. They then proceeded to tell us they couldn't find our order. We were told they would make the pizza shortly. They did not seem concerned about the mix up. We stood in the lobby for over an hour waiting for two pizzas and there was no concern for our inconvenience. We were so disappointed in this customer service action and given the fact that your pizza is delicious, the customer service side of this is very insufficient. They reimbursed us for the pizza after we shouted out our complaint finally. But this is hurting your business and there is a need for improvement. People will go to your competition with this type of customer service.","Nov. 7, 2015",1,5

When I opened the box, half of the pizza was GONE. Now that ticked me off so I marched up there and told her what was wrong with the pizza.

I signed his second receipt and did all I was asked to do. The driver was really rude to me on his second visit. Then claimed to his management that I was rude to him because I believe he, the driver knew I was going to report him to his corporate office.

We've ordered from this location multiple times but apparently this time they've chosen to lose our business. Way to give such crappy customer service and ruin an otherwise great night. Domino's all the way from now on, they're always polite and actually deliver our orders. Sounds like PR needs to teach your employees some manners. Also, it's almost impossible to send a review directly to Pizza Hut in order to air your grievances. The website link that they provide is consistently down.","June 28, 2015",1,5

An hour later I called and a girl promised to bring our coke in 30 minutes.

535,I loved Pizza Hut... But I'm very disappointed. I ordered 3 pizzas with the new crust and sauces. Crust had no flavor and my pizzas were very soggy. I was told that if I wanted it cooked better I needed to request well done. I use to work at Pizza Hut so I know even if it does not call for well done it still needs to be cooked. I will not be ordering pizza from there again.,"March 11, 2015",1,4

He states, ""Oh ok, I'll make it."" Not once did he say I apologize and/or any compensation. He says yeah not yes, and speaks so fast that it makes me feel discounted and at the end of my call like I made a mistake calling Pizza Hut. I will not use or recommend Pizza Hut to my neighbors...

It was 7:10pm and the pizza had not arrived yet so I called and spoke to the assistant manager and they said the delivery person was running a little late. I waited until 8:45pm and still no pizza so I called the store and no one picked up so I called the assistant manager's cell phone number that he gave me and told him that I waited another almost 2 hours and wanted to know when my pizza was going to arrive. The assistant manager just used curse language at me over the phone then hung up. I never got my pizza or a refund from the company.

This new business model is terrible. While efficient on paper, the employees at the call center have no idea what they are doing which I'm sure can be attributed to them not being provided with the information to help anyone. I will no longer order from Pizza Hut. I was also charged for my pizza before I was told what the wait time would be.","March 1, 2015",1,0

Ordered a bacon pizza with stuffed cheese crust, a pepperoni pizza, and root beer. The only thing decent about the experience was the root beer. The bacon pizza was smushed to one side of the box. It was orange with grease and it tasted awful; the pepperoni wasn't any different. You can get better and cheaper pizza at Little Caesars ($5 for a large, hot and ready), and you can get very good quality pizza at Mancino's - either way anything beats Pizza Hut.

We are actually a lot closer to Domino's but in the past we would rather order from Pizza Hut. The ""new"" crusts that this corporation is using is not even tasty like it used to be. I understand that Pizza Hut would like to possibly make shortcuts by changing the crust, sauces, wings, etc...but is it really worth it in the long run? It's not quantity, it's QUALITY. If you really look at other reviews, you'll see a lot of others feel the same way. We really hope that this corporation will reconsider the changes they're making, or you might be losing more business than expected.","Feb. 18, 2015",1,5

They'd screwed up our order and charged him for the pepperoni! We called up there and my number was credited with a large free pizza. So, we got a large cheese pizza. He went and got it and it was all fine. We ate and it tasted great. But then the nausea hit. I thought it was because I'm pregnant until my boyfriend said he felt sick too.

Every day, poorly paid employees come to work under extremely stressful, understaffed stores where many are mistreated by apathetic managers. Most just struggling to make ends meet under the constant fear of being fired for the simplest things. Boy! That sounds fun doesn't it? These un-thanked people are charged with producing meals for roughly 1 in every 7 people in the towns and cities where they work. That’s a boat load of work that gets handled usually by less than 6 workers at any given time. Their drivers log thousands of miles in heavy traffic and hazardous weather conditions. So what kind of thanks do they get? They get little of none for the several hundred perfect pizzas they made and a bus load of ** and whining when they inevitably mess one up.

We tried calling the store to inform them however the manager was completely rude and expected us to drive to the store to get different ones. If we paid to have edible food delivered why would we expect to drive to the store if they made a mistake. Through her rudeness and obnoxious behavior I explained that we will not drive all the way there to return them and requested a refund for just that amount since there were not willing to deliver a fresh batch. She stated once the driver returns with the receipt we'll be charged and there's nothing we can do. I think the credit card company has the last say-so on what gets paid.

It was obvious that many other diners were also becoming annoyed and finding it hard to enjoy their meals as well. I asked to speak to the mgr, whose name is ""Bridgett"", asked her kindly if she would speak with one of the parents and ask them to quiet down the children a bit. She said she could not do that because they were children, they were a team (of some sort, and there did appear to be a coach who appeared to in charge), and they had the right to behave however they wanted to. Taken aback, I said, ""then if you will not speak to them, I will."" She then informed me that I could not do that because they had as much right to be there as I.

They picked up and said ""The driver said he left it at the desk, like you had on the ticket"". I said, ""What business did he leave it at, because no one notified me. It's not here!"" Then she asked and the driver said it was not left at the right place. ","Aug. 7, 2014",1,16
584,"I had a problem with a recent order (hair in the pizza) and I tried to call the local restaurant number, but instead I got a call center guy who didn't know what was going on. He spent more time on the phone explaining that he was not able help me but would transfer me to the store. By the time he actually connected me to the location I was trying to call in the first place, my frustration level was way up. This is just a bad move on PH's part in my opinion. It has become impossible to reach anyone local by phone. I'd much rather speak to the people at Papa John's or Domino's just because they don't make me run through an obstacle course to be a customer.","July 20, 2014",1,7
585,"I ordered online from the Pizza Hut store servicing my area. The person who delivered my pizza, whom I found out was also the manager; his name was Jamal. Initially, he started off by saying that he doesn't sell spoiled products, to which I replied, ""why is it that the very first piece of meat which happened to be a piece of ham, when I tried to bite a piece of it being almost paper-thin, it wouldn't break-off? Felt like I was biting into a piece of rubber."" To top that off since it originally looked discolored and all, I put it up to my nose to smell it; It smelled rancid/spoiled.","April 22, 2014",1,9
586,"I ordered a pizza on the phone. When I went to pick it up, I was ignored for about 15 minutes. I noticed people standing watching me as stood at the counter. Suddenly a gentleman who was Caucasian walked in and was immediately address. I am a black senior citizen although it should never make a difference, age, religion, or race. I thought that was history. I see in BELLEVILLE, Illinois on Carlyle it is present. I was spoken to very disrespectful.","April 19, 2014",1,6
587,"I ordered delivery from 700 Maguire Blvd, Orlando, FL 32803. As soon as the delivery driver pulled away I opened the box to discover an empty item (I ordered a meat lovers and it literally was just a pizza crust). I immediately called the store and explained that I was delivered just a pizza crust. The person who answered (female) said they could either make me a new one or give me a store credit. I informed her I didn't want a new one because I had waited 45 minutes on the first one and it was now way past a normal dinner time and I didn't want a store credit because I rarely order from this Pizza Hut (because of the horrible customer service I've received in the past). I let her know the delivery driver had just pulled out and he could pull back in, get the item and take it back, and credit my credit card back. She refused. She said if I wanted a refund then I had to drive to the store. I was floored. ","March 29, 2014",1,20
588,"I was at oasis center in Dubai. I ordered one pizza combo...and they gave me a no. that will alarm when the food is done. So I was waiting for more than 15 mins and I was in the table near. I realize that my break time is almost finish but the food is not yet done. I see the staff are just laughing and talking so I try to ask them ..Then I saw that the food was just waiting there and no one bother to call me. Then I ask why they take too much time. They said they still doing it. And I ask if I can have a hot sauce, she said I have to buy for one dirhams. And they didn't even bother to ask me what drinks I want, they just decided to give me cola. It's really bad .. When you're tired and hungry and will encounter this kind of service you will feel disappointed.","Jan. 21, 2014",2,5
589,"I had an issue with Pizza Hut delivery, which after looking at some on here seems kind of silly. I was unable to get delivery from a carry out store 1.48 miles from my house. I went through the typical process from Pizza Hut both on the phone and online, getting an email response saying that their routes are created to best service the customers with the drivers they have in the assigned routed areas. I found this answer to be unacceptable since at the most, in the heaviest of traffic, I am 10 minutes from the store. I would not even care about this but my son had to walk more than once just to get a pizza from them. We are longtime Pizza Hut customers.","Oct. 7, 2013",3,5
590,"We called Pizza Hut and got no answer initially at the local store in Cottage Grove, MN. The call went to a call center where an employee took our order. She got it all wrong when she repeated it back to us and said the total was over $50 because she tacked on things we did not want. She truly must have been stoned. We corrected her and she got very mad so we tried to just cancel the order. My son was talking to her and had her on speakerphone. I could hear her from another room screaming at him and not letting him get a word in edgewise. At that point all he wanted was to cancel it and she was saying that his card was already charged and too bad, but she would not serve him anyway. I had never heard anything so rude in my life. ","April 28, 2013",1,13
591,"It should come as no surprise to me that my recent trip to Pizza Hut ended in utter disappointment yet again. I'm not sure why I continue to put myself in the same situation again and again. Today, I had to wait 20+ minutes as 3 employees hovered around confused and had no plan but to react to the chaos around them. When I finally got to the counter after watching the 2 dissatisfied customers in front of me who had orders that, too, were completely wrong and or not there because one was mistakenly delivered to a business address and the other just simply wasn't there at all, I wondered to myself at this point if maybe it was a hidden camera show or I was being punked?

592,"I went to the Pizza Hut on Houston Road. I was at the window for almost fifteen minutes. I noticed from the window that two pizzas were sitting on the counter alone, not in the warmer; they were on the side, just sitting there. If I sat at the window for fifteen minutes, how long had the pizzas been there? Long story short, I went inside and told her I was sitting there. She was like, I did not see you. Anyway, I paid for my pizzas. Lo and behold, guess whose pizzas were sitting on the side. Mine. I told her those were just sitting there. Her words, ""Do you want a free drink?"" I am like, really?","Feb. 3, 2013",1,6
593,"I was at Belle Glade, Florida Pizza Hut so I was in line to order. I was ordering the big box, but the guy named Ronnie was so rude that he didn't give people enough time to order. The other employees were very loud like they were in a market. I have been going to Pizza Hut since I was six years old. It was the worst experience ever.","Jan. 6, 2013",1,5
594,"I ordered a pizza, thinking I'd get the good food/service that I'd grown accustom to growing up. I called the Pizza Hut at 3103 1960 East in Houston/Humble area. What a joke! I called at noon and was told that my pie would arrive at 12:30, seeing it's only six blocks away. I called back at 12:50 and 1:00, only to talk to a phone center that gives the orders! Finally, at 1:15, a guy showed up and expected me to pay full price for a pie 45 minutes late! I told him to feed his family and slammed the door! I'm never eating from that chain again. Garbage service! Zero stars!","Dec. 27, 2012",1,11
595,"Pizza Hut 013856 Cottage Grove, MN - Failed health inspection. I came in to pick up my order - two of their overstuffed pizzas. While standing and waiting, I overheard two employees having a discussion about a recent health inspection. When my pizzas were finally ready (long wait at this location), I asked to speak to the manager regarding (the person I asked told me that he is the manager) the recent health inspection. I was told by him (the manager) that they did in fact fail their recent health inspection. I cancelled my order right then and there, walked out and went to some of the other pizza places in the area. After the Cottage Grove Pizza Hut failed their health inspection, I am now going elsewhere for any pizza that I order from now on.","Nov. 27, 2012",1,6
596,"I was parked in the Pizza Hut parking lot. My son went into Pizza Hut to get two pizzas and a drink. My boyfriend and I ate at the restaurant next door. My car was towed, and the manager told me it was because I left the property. The sign said if you are not a Pizza Hut customer, you will be towed. But I was a customer. It cost me $35 for a can and $125 to get my car back. Management was rude and not helpful. I asked them to check the video to see my son was there, and I was told there was no video.","July 20, 2012",1,5
597,"I got such poor customer service and I'm never going back. The employees greeted people as they walked in from the kitchen asking, ""dine in or carry out"" and then asking ""what are you having to drink"". Before they could even get seated, and seating themselves, they had to decide what they were having to drink. I sat and watched as employees ate in the kitchen, took food from the buffet, sipped on sodas and talked to customers all from the kitchen. I asked for my check and the waitress (female). Is it okay to call her a waitress? So, I mean the ""server"" told me to meet her up front. And I was like, so that's how it's done? Trash all over the seats and on the floor. Very Nasty.","May 29, 2012",2,4
598,"I was calling Pizza center 1300822020 for order at around 1915 hrs. Then the staff said it will be delivered in 30 minutes, standard time. After waiting 50 minutes there was no delivery. While waiting until 50 minutes, there was no staff from Pizza that called to inform me back of any delay or a problem. Then I called back personally and asked why my order was still not received. Your staff simply told me maybe there's a problem with the restaurant. This is bad service and worse. Pizza person in-charge, you want to know the best service from your site. The pizza that I ordered at 1915hrs was sent at 2030 hrs. Please take note of it.","April 29, 2012",1,4

We expected that. Well, at 8:15 pm, we decided to call them about the order. The guy couldn't even find the order for the first few minutes. As he is asking me about my receipt, he told me the order was cancelled. He said they're out of all food that we ordered. We ordered a pizza, man! How are you out of pizza at a pizza restaurant!

600,"I am complaining because my 68-year old father fell and got hurt really bad. The bathroom is not handicap accessible and there is a hidden drained on floor right when you walk in stall. There is no room for anyone that might be in a wheel chair to even turn around. Back to the drain, it is very dangerous not just for handicap like my dad but it is dangerous for any male that walks in there and doesn't notice it. My father is a victim of Pizza Hut's hazardous bathroom. He did not see this hole and fell and hurt his back really bad. He now has to go to therapy three days a week and is in constant pain, all because Pizza Hut couldn't take some of their profit and make a handicap accessible bathroom. Even if Pizza Hut don't want handicap proposing their stores then they can at least invest into a safe bathroom. ","March 9, 2012",1,2

He said they could not do just cheese and then he said he could but it would be extra. I told my mother I would pay the extra. My mother was asking the cashier something and the cashier just stared at me and said, ""You know what, I own this store and I don't have to serve either of you.""

I pointed out that neither the print advertisement nor TV advertisement say there is an extra charge for stuffed crust. I asked to speak to the store manager.
